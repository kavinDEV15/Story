hello came to here by using touch, still havent commited itthough.

okay, here are the git commands i learnt.

git init - to initialize git into a directory
git add sample.txt - to add a file into the repo(intermediate lane)
git log - to view the status of the files in directory
git commit -m "this is a sample message in present tense only" - to log into the version control.
git diff filename.txt - we can find the difference.
git checkout filename.txt - to rollback to prev comited version.

//to create a remote git
git remote add origin link
git push -u origin main

//to merge branches
go to main branch and then run this
git merge bname
//to escape Vim enter !q
